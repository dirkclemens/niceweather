# Nice Weather

iOS Swift App

Demo App for iOS with implementation of OpenWeatherAPI and LocationManager created using https://chat.openai.com    
Tried to use the MVVM Model View ViewModel pattern, lots of room for improvements - still work in progress    

Add OpenWeatherAPI Key to Constants.swift in line `static let openWeatherApiKey = "..."`
